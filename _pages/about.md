Hey, thanks for stopping by! :wave: 

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [National University Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), 
where I was fortunated to be mentored by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Jingrui He](https://www.hejingrui.org/).

<strong>Research:</strong> My interest spans multiple areas, including representation learning, trustworthy machine learning, and data-centric AI.
I am particularly interested in developing *Data Optimization* methods to improve the efficiency, reliability and interpretability of ML models from a data-centric view.
In the long run, I want to make machine learning techniques accessible to everyone and enhance people's lives by making it cost-efficient and trustworthy.

**Feel free to drop me an e-mail or contact me by twitter, if you are interested in my research and want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations!** :smile:
